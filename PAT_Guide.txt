GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) Setup Guide
---------------------------------------------------

Follow these steps to create and enable a Personal Access Token (PAT) for use with GitChat:

1. Go to GitHub:
   https://github.com/settings/tokens

2. Click on "Classic tokens"

3. Click "Generate new token".
   -Choose "Generate new token (Classic)"

4. Set the following options:
   - Name: Give accordingly
   - Expiration: Choose 30 days, 90 days, or "No expiration"(Recomended as you need to generate if time period expires)
   - Scopes (check these):
     ✅ repo        (Full control of private repositories)
     ✅ workflow    (Optional: needed for GitHub Actions if ever used)

5. Click "Generate token"

6. IMPORTANT: Copy the token immediately and save it somewhere safe.
   You won’t be able to view it again.

7. Keep the token secure:
   - DO NOT commit it to GitHub
   - Store it locally in `config.json` and add that file to `.gitignore`

Done! You can now use GitChat to access your private GitHub repository.
