GitChat is a lightweight GitHub-powered chat app that allows two users to exchange messages by syncing through their **private GitHub repositories**.

Built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) and [GitPython](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython), it creates a Git-backed text chat where every conversation is version-controlled â€” and totally owned by you.
